#Introduction
The Simple OCR Application is a lightweight Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that converts images of text into editable digital text. This project utilizes Python's Tesseract-OCR engine, making it easy to extract text from images with minimal setup. It's a perfect starting point for developers who want to integrate OCR into their projects.

#Features
Text extraction from images using Tesseract-OCR.
Support for various image formats such as PNG, JPEG, BMP, etc.
Basic image preprocessing to enhance text recognition accuracy.
Multi-language support for text extraction.
Command-line interface for easy interaction.
Installation
To get started with the Simple OCR Application, follow these steps:

#Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Simple_OCR_Application.git
cd Simple_OCR_Application
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code

Usage
Run the OCR application:

To extract text from an image, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
python ocr.py --image path_to_image.png
Specify Language (optional):

If your image contains text in a language other than English, specify the language code:
bash
Copy code
python ocr.py --image path_to_image.png --lang fra
Preprocess Images (optional):

You can enable basic preprocessing to enhance OCR accuracy:
bash
Copy code
python ocr.py --image path_to_image.png --preprocess
